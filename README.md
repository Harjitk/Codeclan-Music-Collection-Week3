# week_3-music-collections-hw

I created an app which allows a music collector to manage their collection of records. I used Ruby and SQL to create and 
save Artists and Albums and I was able to list these. I worked on extensions by editing, deleting artist/ albums and and being able
to find an artist/album by their ID.
